Hugo Material Book is a script and boilerplate project for multivolume
documentation generated with Hugo (a static site generator) and the
hugo-material-docs theme.

The most awesome feature is that it includes PDF generation with
pandoc and LaTeX.

You can generate PDFs for a single book with multiple parts, a book
for each part individually, and/or an article for each chapter
individually.

Of course, you are mostly limited to a common subset of Hugo and
Pandoc markdown.  However, a preprocessor can be used to fill in some
of the gaps.  For example, this makes the note and warning blocks in
material-docs available in the PDF.
