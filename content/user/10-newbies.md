## Features for the beginner

It is good to start small.  So here are some features for beginners:

* You can make text **bold**, _italic_ or ~~crossed out~~.
* You can add headers such as the one above ("Features for beginners").
* You can add inline code such as `print "Hello World"`.

## More about headers

Each chapter is in its own file and starts with a second-level header (`##`).

Headers should be unique within a chapter, so they can be referenced
in links (more about links can be found in the chapter "Advanced").
