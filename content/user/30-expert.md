## Expert level

### Tables

Tables for HTML and PDF must be entered in the simple style:

Day of week   | Desperation level
--------------|---------------------
monday        | What's despair? Let's get started!
tuesday       | This is harder than I thought...
wednesday     | I can't believe I am doing this.
thursday      | Why does everbody put stones in my way?
friday        | I give up.  Is it weekend already?

All row content must be on the same line.  To adjust the table width
in LaTeX output, simply adjust the width of the column in ASCII
(adding or subtracting minus signs).  The LaTeX column width tries to
keep the same proportions as the ASCII text.
